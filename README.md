# Learning Design

I'm learning design. This is my collection of resources, summaries, and thoughts. 

This is just as much for me, as for others, who find it useful. 

Tweet me [@josephjguerra](https://twitter.com/josephjguerra) to talk about it.

##Background

When I say design, I mean design as a problem solving method. I mean design strategy, design thinking, user research, user experience, product management, and technical team leadership. I also mean graphic and aesthetic design, but those interest me less. 

I like to combine learning design with front-end web development. Knowing some HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks serves me two purposes. First, it allows me to bring my ideas and prototypes to life. More importantly, it helps me lead technical teams, understand their realm, and sometimes contribute. 

I'm on various teams who build digital (and physical) products. Most for small businesses and the local community. I still have plenty to learn. This is the place to capture that progress.
