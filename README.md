# Product Design

👋 I'm Joe G. Senior product manager, strategist, owner, and design sprint facilitator.

📜 These are my curated lists of product and design resources. These made me into the [product person](https://josephjguerra.com/) that I am today!

❤️ May these lists be helpful for you! Especially if you are a newer product person, or are curious about my opinions.

## Background

When I say product design, I mean holistic problem solving methods with software. I mean product strategy, design thinking, user research, user experience, product management, and technical team leadership.

I like to combine my product and design experience with basic front-end web development knowledge. Knowing some HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks serves two purposes. First, it allows me to bring ideas and prototypes to life on my own. (No-code is an option too!) And it helps me work with technical teams and understand their space.
